SATELLITE-BASED LAND USE CLASSIFICATION PROJECT
Project title
Land use and Land cover mapping Using satellite Imagery

Objective
This project demonstrates the application of satellite remote sensing and GIS techniques to classify and analyze land use and land cover (LULC) patterns in a selected region. The goal is to showcase environmental spatial analysis skills relevant for sustainable development and urban planning.

Data Source
Satellite Imagery: Sentinel-2 / Landsat-8 (processed image shown in PDF)
Imagery Type: Multispectral imagery (used for detecting vegetation, water bodies, and built-up areas)

Tools & Software Used:
-QGIS (Open-source GIS Software), LANDSAT,GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE
- Remote Sensing Techniques: Band combinations, NDVI, supervised classification
- PDF Output: Final map layout created and exported as a high-resolution image

 Project Content:	
- `satellite-map.pdf`: The final classified map showing distinct land cover types (e.g., vegetation, urban area, water).
- `README.md`: This documentation explaining the project process and purpose.

Methodology Summary:
1. Pre-processed satellite image was imported into QGIS.
2. Appropriate band combinations were applied for land classification.
3. Supervised classification techniques were used to identify major land cover types.
4. Final map layout was styled and exported as a PDF for presentation.

 Significance:
Understanding land use patterns is critical for sustainable planning, climate monitoring, and biodiversity conservation. This project demonstrates the ability to interpret satellite data and apply GIS techniques - a valuable skill for geospatial programs and environmental applications.

Notes:
- This project was developed as part of a geospatial analysis portfolio for academic and increase of skill and familiarity with GIS tools use in real world application
- 
- No raw satellite imagery is provided here due to file size constraints; however, the methodology is reproducible using open data sources such as [Copernicus Open Access Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/) or [USGS EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/).
